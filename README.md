# Assignment 1
This is my first Git and GitHub assignment: Learn about Git / Github
## Assignment Details
- updated version of the README.

### Steps I Tested

1. Ran `git init` to initialize a local Git repository.
2. Used `git add .` to stage all changes for commit.
3. Checked the status of my files with `git status`.
4. Committed the changes with `git commit -m "First commit"`.
5. Added the GitHub repository as a remote with `git remote add origin <repo_url>`.
6. Pushed the changes to GitHub with `git push -u origin master`.
7. Ran `git diff` to view uncommitted changes.
8. Used `git log` to verify the commit history.
9. Tested `git checkout` to revert a file to the last committed version.
